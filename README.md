# Senior Portfolio

### 1. [Chatroom Server and Client Application](https://github.com/ColePolychronis/ChatRoomProject/tree/4563401ba60784c360f9bac90e9f0f1a894ca134)

I worked on this project for my Computer Networks (CMPT 352) class at Westminster College. At its core, this final project had 3 major aspects: develop a chatroom protocol that would be used by both the server and client application we would design, develop a server that could facilitate connections from multiple clients at a time, and develop a client side application that would allow a client to send a message to all connected clients or send a private message to a subset of the clients currently connected. The other key aspect of this chatroom project is that it was a group project (teams of two). This project was significant in that it is one of the first projects in the Westminster CS curriculum where students are given relatively little direction about how to design the software; instead, it is up to the teams to figure out how to best implement the protocol developed by the class as a whole. Ultimately, our class settled on using a JSON-based protocol, and my teammate and I decided on using Java to develop the server and client-side applications, as this would allow us to harness the robust threading libraries that Java has available.

I elected to include this project in my portfolio because I think it is the project that encouraged the most development in my problem solving skills. For one, my partner and I spent roughly a day and a half sketching out our server, our client application, and pseudocode for how to facilitate communcation between the two. Once we had our outline of what the project should look like, we then had engage the project at a lower level and figure out what kinds of datastructures and types we would have to use to ensure that our software was thread safe. This project was also a fantastic way for figuring out how to manage a relatively large software project in a group setting. Specfically, because I was only working with one partner, this project really required me to communicate clearly and effectively, because my partner and I had to be on the same page constantly in order to understand what each of us were supposed to be working on and how the pseudocode we had sketched out was to be split up into smaller tasks. In addition, the collaborative nature of this project encouraged me to become more familiar with Git and Slack, two important tools that will not only be useful to me for the rest of my academic career, but will, I imagine, also be invaluable to me once I start my career in industry.
