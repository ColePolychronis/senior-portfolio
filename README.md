### 1. [Chatroom Server and Client Application](https://github.com/ColePolychronis/ChatRoomProject/tree/4563401ba60784c360f9bac90e9f0f1a894ca134)

I worked on this project for my Computer Networks (CMPT 352) class at Westminster College. At its core, this final project had 3 major aspects: develop a chatroom protocol that would be used by both the server and client application we would design, develop a server that could facilitate connections from multiple clients at a time, and develop a client side application that would allow a client to send a message to all connected clients or send a private message to a subset of the clients currently connected. The other key aspect of this chatroom project is that it was a group project (teams of two). This project was significant in that it is one of the first projects in the Westminster CS curriculum where students are given relatively little direction about how to design the software; instead, it is up to the teams to figure out how to best implement the protocol developed by the class as a whole. Ultimately, our class settled on using a JSON-based protocol, and my teammate and I decided on using Java to develop the server and client-side applications, as this would allow us to harness the robust threading libraries that Java has available.
