# Senior Portfolio

### 1. [Chatroom Server and Client Application](https://github.com/ColePolychronis/ChatRoomProject/tree/4563401ba60784c360f9bac90e9f0f1a894ca134)

I worked on this project for my Computer Networks (CMPT 352) class at Westminster College. At its core, this final project had three major aspects: develop a chatroom protocol that would be used by both the server and client application we would design, develop a server that could facilitate connections from multiple clients at a time, and develop a client side application that would allow a client to send a message to all connected clients or send a private message to a subset of the clients currently connected. The other key aspect of this chatroom project is that it was a group project (teams of two). This project was significant in that it is one of the first projects in the Westminster CS curriculum where students are given relatively little direction about how to design the software; instead, it is up to the teams to figure out how to best implement the protocol developed by the class as a whole. Ultimately, our class settled on using a JSON-based protocol, and my teammate and I decided on using Java to develop the server and client-side applications, as this would allow us to harness the robust threading libraries that Java has available.

I elected to include this project in my portfolio because I think it is the project that encouraged the most development in my problem solving skills. For one, my partner and I spent roughly a day and a half sketching out our server, our client application, and pseudocode for how to facilitate communcation between the two. Once we had our outline of what the project should look like, we then had engage the project at a lower level and figure out what kinds of datastructures and types we would have to use to ensure that our software was thread safe. This project was also a fantastic way for figuring out how to manage a relatively large software project in a group setting. Specfically, because I was only working with one partner, this project really required me to communicate clearly and effectively, because my partner and I had to be on the same page constantly in order to understand what each of us were supposed to be working on and how the pseudocode we had sketched out was to be split up into smaller tasks. In addition, the collaborative nature of this project encouraged me to become more familiar with Git and Slack, two important tools that will not only be useful to me for the rest of my academic career, but will, I imagine, also be invaluable to me once I start my career in industry.

### 2. [Island Hopper Children's Math Game](https://github.com/ColePolychronis/senior-portfolio/tree/master/IslandHopperGame)

I worked on this project throughout the entire semester for my Computer Software (CMPT 322) class at Westminster College. The project itself is meant to be a way for us as computer science students to get a sense of what working on a project in industry is like. To this end, it is a group project (teams of 4), that consists of three releases and is bound by certain client specifications. For our project specifically, my team and I built a math game targeted at children with the goal of teaching them how to add and subtract numbers, as well as identifying place values, using colorful visuals and engaging game elements. To this end, we developed a creature collection game (similar to popular games such as Pokemon) that required users to visit different islands and answer math questions in order to collect creatures that could be viewed and interacted with upon collection. To implement this vision, we developed our backend using the Spring Boot framework and Java, backed with a PostgreSQL database and developed our frontend using Angular 5.

I wanted to showcase this project in my senior portfolio for two key reasons, with the first of these being that this project was the single most pivotal project in helping me to understand the concepts and techniques of software design. This project required a tremendous amount of planning and revising, with our team spending almost an entire month figuring out the tech-stack that we wanted to use, and then using said stack to develop a proof of concept to showcase for our first release. Throughout the duration of working on this project, my team and I also learned how to break down a software project into smaller user stories and then estimate how much time these stories would take to implement. Finally, this project also required us to become much more comfortable with using Git, both as a means of version control, as well as a means of code sharing. 

The other reason I chose to include this project in my portfolio is that it was also the most substantial experience I have had as far as working in a group setting. The sheer scale of this project meant that it was effectively impossible for one person to undertake, which forced clear communication of what each team member's role was and by extension, what everyone was responsible for getting done. This is something that my team and I were not very good at in the beginning, and as a result, the distribution of work was very unbalanced and the product we showcased for our first release suffered. However, we continued working on building these skills and using the tools available to us (such as Slack and GitHub) to communicate more effectively, and as a result, we had an almost perfect distribution of work between every member of our team and were able to showcase a finished product that we were proud of.
